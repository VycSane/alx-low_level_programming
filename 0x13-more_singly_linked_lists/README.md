This is a project on linked lists. The description for the implemented functions are as follows:

1. The 0-print_listint.c houses a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

2. The 1-listint_len.c houses a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

3. The 2-add_nodeint.c houses a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

4. The 3-add_nodeint_end.c houses a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

5. The 4-free_listint.c houses a function that frees a list_t list.

6. The 5-free_listint2.c houses a function that frees a listint_t list.

7. The 6-pop_listint.c houses a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n).

8. The 7-get_nodeint.c houses a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list.

9. The 8-sum_listint.c houses a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list.
